## My Full-Stack Web Application
This project is a fully functional full-stack web application that showcases a wide range of my development skills. It includes essential features such as user authentication, course management (both public and private courses), database integration, and a robust contact form with full validation. Built with modern web development tools, this application demonstrates my expertise in back-end and front-end technologies, as well as database management.

## Key Features and Functionalities:
## 1. User Authentication (Login/Logout)
```
Secure Login/Logout System: Built with secure authentication and authorization methods to ensure data privacy.
Session Management: Ensures persistent login sessions and secure logout to safeguard user information.
Password Encryption: Passwords are securely stored using industry-standard hashing techniques to protect user credentials.
```
## 2. Course Management
```
Public Courses:
Users can view and access public courses without needing an account.
Private Courses:
Only authenticated users can access private courses, ensuring the exclusivity of certain content.
Course Enrollment:
The platform includes the ability for users to enroll in courses, with databases tracking enrollment and course progress.
```

## 3. Database Integration
```
Comprehensive Database System:
Fully integrated with a database (such as MongoDB or SQL) to manage users, course content, and other data efficiently.
Data Validation:
Backend validation ensures that all data entered (user details, course data) is accurate and securely stored in the database.
```

## 4. Full Validation on Forms
```
Complete Form Validation:
The website ensures full client-side and server-side validation for user input fields, making sure that forms are correctly filled out and secure.
Error Handling:
Users are provided with real-time error feedback for incomplete or invalid form submissions.
```

## 5. Functional Contact Form
```
Interactive Contact Form:
Includes a fully functional contact form where users can send inquiries. The form includes:
Fields for Full Name, Email, Phone Number, and Message.
Validation for each field to ensure accurate data entry.
Email Notifications: The admin receives notifications when a new message is submitted.
```

## 6. Additional Features
```
Responsive Design:
The entire application is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Role-Based Access Control:
Different users (admin, instructor, student) have different levels of access, ensuring the security and organization of content and data.
API Integration:
Integrated with external APIs for advanced features, such as course recommendations or progress tracking.
Technologies Used:
Front-End:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
React.js for dynamic, responsive UI
Tailwind CSS for efficient styling
Back-End:
Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic
Secure handling of authentication via JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Database:
MongoDB / MySQL for storing user and course data securely
Additional Tools:
Postman for API testing
Git for version control
ESLint for code quality
Vite for fast front-end build and development server
```
